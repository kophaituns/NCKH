## 🧪 What to Test

### Login Flows to Test

**1. Admin Login**
```
Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123
Expected: Admin dashboard with user management
```

Password: teacher123
Expected: Teacher dashboard with survey management
```

**3. Student Login**
```
Email: student1@example.com
Password: student123
Expected: Student dashboard with available surveys

### Features to Test After Login

- [ ] Navigate to different pages
- [ ] Check that Authorization header is sent (DevTools → Network)
- [ ] Wait 24+ hours (or modify token) to test refresh token
- [ ] Check localStorage has encrypted tokens
- [ ] Logout and verify session is cleared

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Still getting CORS error"
1. Hard refresh browser: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows)
2. Clear cache: DevTools → Application → Clear Storage
3. Restart both backend and frontend
4. Check backend console for errors

### "Login page won't load"
1. Verify frontend is running on port 3001
2. Check if port is already in use: `netstat -ano | findstr :3001`
3. Restart frontend: `npm start` in Frontend/AGS-react folder

### "Login fails after entering credentials"
1. Check backend console for errors
2. Verify database is running (MySQL on port 3306)
3. Check that test account exists in database
4. Verify .env.local has correct API_URL

### "No data appears on dashboard"
1. This is expected if API endpoints aren't fully implemented yet
2. At minimum, authentication should work
3. Check Network tab to see if data requests are being made
